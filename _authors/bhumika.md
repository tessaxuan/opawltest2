Throughout her professional career and personal life, Bhumika has sought to create safe spaces for marginalized groups through grassroots coalition building as well as through facilitating workshops on topics related to feminism and social justice. Bhumika also serves as Alumni Engagement Chair for the Columbus Chapter of New Leaders Council.
